## Determining what to review

Based on the input provided, determine which type of review to perform:

1. **No arguments (default)**: Review all uncommitted changes
   - Run: `git diff` for unstaged changes
   - Run: `git diff --cached` for staged changes
   - Run: `git status --short` to identify untracked (net new) files

2. **Commit hash** (40-char SHA or short hash): Review that specific commit
   - Run: `git show $ARGUMENTS`

3. **Branch name**: Compare current branch to the specified branch
   - Run: `git diff $ARGUMENTS...HEAD`

4. **PR URL or number** (contains "github.com" or "pull" or looks like a PR number): Review the pull request
   - Run: `gh pr view $ARGUMENTS` to get PR context
   - Run: `gh pr diff $ARGUMENTS` to get the diff
